Revenue for Nvidia's biggest server maker and Apple's top iPhone assembler jumped 11% from the same quarter last year to T$2.057 trillion ($67.71 billion), Foxconn said in a statement on Sunday.  While that was below the T$2.134 trillion LSEG SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate, Foxconn said the result was better than expected."

    "summary": "MUMBAI (Reuters) -The Indian rupee's recent slide may help soften the blow from higher U.S. tariffs, economists said, with trade tensions between New Delhi and Washington intensifying under President Donald Trump.  Bankers said the currency would probably have breached the 88 mark if not for likely intervention by the Reserve Bank of India via state-run banks.  The steeper U.S. tariffs imposed on India last week compared to other Asian countries — along with Trump's threat of further penalties — are seen keeping the rupee under pressure."

Asian currencies were flat-to-slightly higher, while the dollar index declined by nearly 0.2% to 98.2.  The Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah are among the few regional currencies nursing losses on the year so far, even as their peers, such as the Taiwan dollar and the Korean won, have climbed over 11% and 6%, respectively."
